**Comprehensive Analysis & Visualization with Python
In this project, I conducted an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a heart disease dataset to uncover insights into factors contributing to cardiovascular disease (CVD). 
The analysis involved understanding the distribution of data, identifying patterns, anomalies, and correlations among various features.

Key Highlights:
- Performed detailed data cleaning and preprocessing, ensuring accuracy and consistency.
- Visualized distributions and relationships between variables such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, and exercise-induced angina.
-Analyzed and visualized the correlation between different factors and heart disease status.
-Created insightful plots to reveal trends and patterns in the data using tools like Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Key Insights:
- Heart disease prevalence is higher among females (75%) compared to males (45%).
-The cp (chest pain type) and thalach (maximum heart rate) variables showed positive correlations with heart disease.
-Visualized and explored key features like exercise-induced angina, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure to understand their impact on CVD.
-This project enhanced my skills in data cleaning, visualization, and exploratory data analysis, and deepened my understanding of the impact of lifestyle and physiological factors on heart disease.
